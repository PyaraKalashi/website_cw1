                    Ocean acidification is a long-term decline in ocean pH caused mostly by the absorption of CO2 from the atmosphere.<br>
                    ocean acidification is sometimes called <i>"osteoporosis of the sea."</i><br>Oysters, clams, lobsters,
                    shrimp, coral reefs, and other marine species depend on minerals to develop their shells and skeletons,<br>and ocean acidification may destroy them.

                <div class="Description">A pH of 7, as found in pure water, is neutral.<br>Ammonia and bleach, on the 
                    other hand, are basic, with pH values of 11 and 13.5, respectively.
                    <br><br>Our oceans store a wide variety of species with an average pH of 8.1, making seawater mildly 
                    basic. However, researchers believe that by the end of the twenty-first century, the pH of ocean water could have dropped to 7. 8.

                </div>
                <div class="Description">Carbonic acid is produced when CO2 and water mix, releasing hydrogen and bicarbonate ions.
                    <br>Water becomes increasingly acidic as the number of hydrogen ions increases. 
                    <br>This is one of the main causes of ocean acidification.<br><br>In addition to the use of fossil fuels, 
                    deforestation is an important factor in the sharp rise in ocean acidification.
                    This is because when a forest is cut down or burned, all of the carbon that was stored is released into the atmosphere.

                    CO2 dissolution in oceans decreases carbonate availability, impacting shellfish survival.
                    <br>Research in the Gulf of Maine reveals lower carbonate concentrations directly impact survival, and high acidity could dissolve shells.

                    There are so many ways to reduce ocean acidification. These are some of those.
                    <br>
                   
                        1.Reduce your carbon footprint.<br>
                        2.Stay away from plastics.<br>
                        3.Keep Our Beaches Clean.<br>
                        4.Sustainable Seafood Options.<br>
                        5.Educate yourselves and others.<br>
